% Fig. \ref{fig:nClusters} shows the mean number of clusters and the variation of the mean as a function of $N_l$, for different $\sigma$, as indicated in the legend. The normalized size distribution of the clusters is reported in Fig. \ref{fig:clusterLengthDistribution}.
%
%With a given probability of forming a bond between two nodes that are at a distance $r$ away from each other to be $r^{-\sigma}$, we expect the correlation function $\xi(r)$ (i.e. the distribution of distances at which two nodes are bound) to follow $\sim r^{-\sigma}$. We show in the figure \ref{fig:correlationFunction} the measured average (black, solid line) correlation function and its standard deviation (black, dashed lines) after generating 1000 realizations of the connection graph using Walker's Alias algorithm to draw the bonds among the nodes. In pink, overlayed on top of the black curve, the fit of the average $\xi(r)$ is shown. We fit $\xi(r)$ to the curve $y = (a r + b) ^{-\sigma}$ and obtain a perfect overlay between the data (the average $\xi(r)$) and the fit curve.

Fig. \ref{fig:nClusters} displays the change in number of clusters for different configurations, for constant $N=1024$, as a function of the number of bonds $N_l.$ Different curves correspond to different  $\sigma$, as indicated by the legend. The standard deviation of the sample mean is reported.

Fig. \ref{fig:clusterLengthDistribution} displays the size distribution of the clusters for different $N_l$, for fixed $N.$ The three panels display the distributions for different values of  $\sigma.$ For visualization purposes, the curves are normalised, since there are less available clusters of length  $N$,  than there are clusters of length 1 (isolated sites), which leading to underrepresentation. 

The order parameter of choice is the magnetization $m = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i s_i $ of the spin chain. Fig. \ref{fig:magnetization} shows the magnetization of the spin chain, for 50 realizations of the Metropolis algorithm. Each curve is due to a different starting spin seed, and a different $J_{ij}$. The parameters for each Ising run is indicated in the panel title. The averaging of $m^2$ across different runs is reported in Fig. \ref{fig:m2}. In order to compare the behavior for different values of  $N_l$ for constant $\sigma$, Fig. \ref{fig:m2-comparison} displays the superimposition of the different runs, whose parameters are indicated in the panel title, and the legend.
