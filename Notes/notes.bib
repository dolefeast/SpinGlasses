abstract="This chapter provides an introduction to cluster Monte Carlo algorithms for classical statistical-mechanical systems. A brief review of the conventional Metropolis algorithm is given, followed by a detailed discussion of the lattice cluster algorithm developed by Swendsen and Wang and the single-cluster variant introduced by Wolff. For continuum systems, the geometric cluster algorithm of Dress and Krauth is described. It is shown how their geometric approach can be generalized to incorporate particle interactions beyond hardcore repulsions, thus forging a connection between the lattice and continuum approaches. Several illustrative examples are discussed.",

  abstract = {The kinetics of phase ordering has been investigated for numerous systems via the growth of the characteristic length scale \ell (t) ~ t^{\alpha } quantifying the size of ordered domains as a function of time t, where \alpha is the growth exponent. The behavior of the squared magnetization \langle m(t)^{2}\rangle has mostly been ignored, even though it is one of the most fundamental observables for spin systems. This is most likely due to its vanishing for quenches in the thermodynamic limit. For finite systems, on the other hand, we show that the squared magnetization does not vanish and may be used as an easier to extract alternative to the characteristic length. In particular, using analytical arguments and numerical simulations, we show that for quenches into the ordered phase, one finds \langle m(t)^{2} \rangle ~ m_0^2 t^{d\alpha }/V, where m_0 is the equilibrium magnetization, d the spatial dimension, and V the volume of the system.}
